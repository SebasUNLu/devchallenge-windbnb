This project is about a simpler version of Airbnb, where you can see the different properties that are available to buy in Finland. The option to filter the results by Location and by number of guests is available.
My experience in this third challenge was like the previous two. With my experience, it was pretty easy, although a few things happened this week that made it take longer than usual. But I was able to pull through and complete it.
